# Challenges Faced

### 1. New Libraries (PrimeReact and PrimeFlex):
   - I have never worked with PrimeReact and PrimeFlex before Unfamiliarity with PrimeReact and PrimeFlex.
   - Because their styling syntax is very similar
     to Tailwind, which I have been using for a while, I found it a bit confusing.
   - It took me some time to digest the syntax and understand how to use it effectively.
   - Although I find PrimeReact very helpful, especially whenever I need anything related to components that are already there,
     I just need to fit my data in. That's why if somehow I get the chance to work with PrimeReact, then I would 
     love to explore more.

### 2. Learning Curve and Adaptation:
   - Transitioning from SCSS (previously familiar) to the styling approach of PrimeReact.
   - Adaptation to a new set of components and their customization.

### 3. Chart.js and Graphs:
   - Even though I have worked with Chart.js to some extent, in this project,
     but learned additional functionalities for line and bar graphs.
   - I have utilized line and bar graphs and added some animations to them. for enhanced user experience.

### 4. World Map Integration:
   - Faced challenges while finding and integrating a world map into the dashboard.
   - Successfully addressed difficulties to create a visually appealing map.

### 5. Design Phase:
   - Designed the entire dashboard in the initial two days.
   - Efficiently crafted the UI with a comprehensive understanding of requirements.

### 6. Deployment Challenges:
#### However, deployment was a part I struggled with a lot
   - Deployed the frontend on Vercel successfully and it's working fantastic.
   - But when it comes to the backend, I tried OnRender, SeeNode, and Railway, but none of them worked out well..
   - In the end, I deployed it on AWS for the first time in my life, and yes, it's working well and marking a significant accomplishment..

### 7. HTTP and HTTPS Conflict:
   - Encountered a conflict between HTTP and HTTPS after deploying frontend and backend separately.
   - Consulted experienced individuals, and a solution suggested was to purchase a domain to resolve the conflict.
   - That is the reasion that Magic-Link Signup is not working in prodection ðŸ˜¥.

### 8. Future Interest in PrimeReact:
   - Despite initial challenges, found PrimeReact highly helpful and would love to work with it again.
   - Appreciated the ease of fitting data into existing components.
